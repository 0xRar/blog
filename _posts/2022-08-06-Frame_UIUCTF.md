## Source-Code:
```php
<?php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
ini_set('display_startup_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
          if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
            $allowed_extensions = array(".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif");
            $filename = $_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"];
            $tmpname = $_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"];
            $target_file = "uploads/" . bin2hex(random_bytes(8)) . "-" .basename($filename);

            $has_extension = false;
            foreach ($allowed_extensions as $extension) {
              if (strpos(strtolower($filename), $extension) !== false) {
                $has_extension = true;
              }
            }
            
            if ($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["size"] < 2000000) {
              if (getimagesize($tmpname) && $has_extension) {
                if (move_uploaded_file($tmpname, $target_file)) {     
                  echo "<div id='frame'><img src='$target_file' alt='Your image failed to load :(' id='submission'></div>";
                } else {
                  echo "There was an error uploading your file. Please contact an admin.";
                }
              } else {
                echo "Your picture is not a picture and could not be framed.";
              }
            } else {
              echo "Your picture is too large for us to process.";
            }
          }
        ?>
```

## Solution:
`Frame` had the tags of (`web, php, beginner`) and it was an easy challenge, this challenge had 146 Solves at the time of writing this post though i solved it much earlier, although i didn't notice there was a source code which took me sometime to get the flag.

this php webapp is just an upload form that lets users upload an image and display the image but only for the extentions (`.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif`) within a frame, so the first thing every player will do is try and upload a webshell, at first i tried uploading a php webshell(`Shell.php`) but there is a checker on the file extention and the content it self, after doing some bypass techniques such as (`Shell.png.php`) etc. 

but than i uploaded a webshell which worked, using the` GIF89a;` header, if the content is being scanned sometimes it can be fooled by putting this header on top of the shellcode, though because of the use of the function `getimagesize()` there might be another way to upload a shell.

this is how my request looked:

i changed the `Content-Type` as well just to make it look more like a gif but it might not have been required to upload the shell

and BOOM! we got a shell, after looking for a minute i found the flag in the `/` directory.
