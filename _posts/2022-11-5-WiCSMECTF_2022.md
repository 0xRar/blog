## Solution:

This is a straight forward challenge for a `Symbol Cipher`, would be really basic if you know about Symbols & the name of the challenge is kind of a hint, for this kind of challenges i go to [dcode.fr](https://dcode.fr/) they have a really good [symbol cipher list](https://www.dcode.fr/symbols-cipher) after looking at the list for about a minute i was able to find the cipher which was the `Zodiac Killer Cipher` and decrypted it using the [zodiac killer decryption](https://www.dcode.fr/zodiac-killer-cipher).

## Insecure blocks:
- Category: Web Security
- Level: Easy
- Points: 50


### Description:
Do you think this developer can prevent you from getting your points?

## Source-Code:
```php
 <?php
  include './.flag.php';

  highlight_file(__FILE__);

  if(preg_match("/flag/",$_GET['echo'])) { 
    echo"Nah , we don't do that here!"; exit(); 
  }
  $_GET['echo'] = urldecode($_GET['echo']);
  if($_GET['echo'] == "flag"){
    echoFlag();
  }

?> 
```

## Solution:
In this challenge we are given a small php webapp that takes a GET parameter: `echo`, and in order to get the flag we need to run the function `echoFlag()` by passing the string `flag` into the echo GET parameter and apparently the code decodes any special characters but from what i've read from the php manual seems like decoding a `$_GET` is bad and the `urldecode` function only decode's ones so it can be fooled by double url encoding your payloads for example this urlencode `%2527`  the urldecode function will decode this into `%27` and it will accept the single quote, so in our case i encoded every char from the word flag and then double encoded it using cyberchef.

Ref: [php manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urldecode.php#48481)

```
# https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp
%66%6C%61%67 = flag

# https://cyberchef.org/#recipe=URL_Encode(true)
%2566%256C%2561%2567 = double url encoded flag
```
